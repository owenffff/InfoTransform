# Colour

*Iconic, ready for a digital world. Our intelligently evolved palette uses a singular colour purposefully to be unmistakable.*

## Key points

Here are the most important things to know:

- **Orange is our signature brand colour.** We must use it as an accent to leave our mark.
- **Use white.** Help our visual brand elements stand out and create a bold contrast.
- **We lead with orange.** When using colour, start with orange. When additional colours are needed, go to our range of tints.
- **We choose colours wisely.** Avoid using too many colours next to each other.

## Lead with orange

By using our singular orange purposefully, it becomes more than distinctive--iconic. Avoid using it as full background fills and diluting its impact. Outside of the logo, orange can be used thoughtfully to indicate action or progress, for instance in calls to action or data visualisations.

## Specifications

To keep our colours consistent, always use the specifications shown here; do not attempt to match colours visually. Avoid using values from files that have been converted automatically between colour modes by your software.

- **RGB and Hex** are for screen use.
- **Pantone and CMYK** are for print use.

When matching our colours outside of the modes listed here, use the colour’s Pantone number as a target. Ask your vendor for assistance when necessary and always request a proof before going into production.

### Primary gradient

We have a dynamic gradient based on our core orange that we use to convey momentum and elevate content. It appears on primary surfaces in combination with focus photography or with the Momentum Mark. On secondary surfaces, it can appear behind data visualisations or as a background for introductory web pages.

The bottom-left to top-right trajectory of colour also communicates optimism. We always position orange top-right.

The Primary gradient has standard and narrow formats. **Do not attempt to recreate the gradient.**
