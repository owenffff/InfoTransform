- Time to create reports reduced by 50%

**Launch Date**: October 30, 2024

**Status**: Feature complete, in QA testing, fixing edge cases with large exports

**Dependencies**: None

---

## Next (Next Quarter: Q1 2025, Jan - Mar)

### üîÆ Custom Document Schemas - Planned

**Problem/Opportunity**: Users need to extract data formats not covered by built-in schemas. Currently, they request custom schemas via support (15 requests/month).

**Target Users**: Enterprise users with unique document types (20% of users, 60% of revenue)

**Success Metrics**:
- 30% of users create at least one custom schema
- Support requests for custom schemas reduced by 80%

- Rate limiting infrastructure
- Developer documentation site
- Sample code & SDKs (Python, JavaScript)

---

### üîÆ Scheduled/Automated Processing - Planned

**Problem/Opportunity**: Users process files from the same sources regularly (e.g., monthly vendor invoices). They want to automate: "Process all files from this email/folder every month."

**Target Users**: Teams with recurring document processing workflows

**Success Metrics**:
- 25% of power users create at least one automated workflow
- 15% of processing happens automatically
- Churn reduced by 10% among target users

- Email processing pipeline
- Scheduling infrastructure

---

## Later (Future: Q2 2025 and Beyond)

### üí° AI-Powered Data Validation - Under Consideration

**Problem/Opportunity**: Users manually review extracted data for errors. AI could automatically flag suspicious or inconsistent values.

**Target Users**: Users processing financial or compliance documents where accuracy is critical

**Why Later**: Requires significant AI/ML investment and training data. Prioritizing core workflow features first.

**Discovery Needed**:
- User research: What validation rules are most valuable?
- Technical feasibility: What accuracy can we achieve?
- Competitive analysis: How do competitors handle this?

---

### üí° Mobile App - Under Consideration

**Why Later**: Current users are primarily desktop users (95%). Mobile demand is unproven (only 8 requests).

**Discovery Needed**:
- User research: What mobile use cases exist?
- Usage analytics: How many users access via mobile web?
- ROI analysis: Investment vs potential user growth

---

### üí° Collaboration Features (Teams, Sharing, Comments) - Under Consideration

**Problem/Opportunity**: Teams want to collaborate on document analysis (share results, comment, assign tasks)

**Target Users**: Teams of 3+ users processing documents together

**Why Later**: Current focus is individual productivity. Need to validate team use cases.

**Discovery Needed**:
- User research: How do teams currently collaborate?
- Competitive analysis: What features do competitors offer?
- Pricing strategy: How to package team features?

---

## Completed (Recently Released)

### ‚úÖ Multi-Model Analysis - Launched Sept 15, 2024

**Outcome**:
- 65% of users tried multiple models (vs 40% goal)
- Processing accuracy improved by 25% for mixed document types
- Support tickets about "wrong data extracted" reduced by 40%

**Learnings**:
- Users don't understand model differences well - need better guidance

- Need comparison view to see results from multiple models

---

### ‚úÖ ZIP Archive Support - Launched Aug 30, 2024

**Outcome**:
- 30% of uploads now use ZIP archives
- Average upload time reduced by 60% for batches
- User satisfaction with upload experience: 8.1/10 (was 6.5)

**Learnings**:
- Users wanted folder structure preserved (not just flat extraction)
- 200MB limit was too small for some users (increased to 500MB)
- Need better error messages when ZIP contains unsupported files

---

## Not Doing (Explicitly Out of Scope)

### ‚ùå Built-in OCR Engine

**Why Not**: Existing solutions (like markitdown, Tesseract) are mature and sufficient. Building our own would take 6+ months with marginal improvement. Better to invest in differentiated features.

**Alternative**: Continuing to use markitdown with possible future integration of other OCR services via plugins

---

### ‚ùå Video Processing

**Why Not**: Very few user requests (3 total). Video processing is computationally expensive and use cases are unclear. Not aligned with document-focused positioning.

**Alternative**: Focusing on audio transcription (more requested), which covers some video use cases (extract audio track)

---

### ‚ùå Blockchain/NFT Integration

**Why Not**: No user demand. Doesn't solve real problems for our users. Buzzword-driven feature request from one stakeholder.

**Alternative**: None needed

---

## Prioritization Framework

**Evaluation Criteria**:
1. **User Impact**: How many users? How significant the pain?
2. **Business Impact**: Revenue, retention, acquisition potential?
3. **Strategic Fit**: Aligns with "efficient document processing" vision?
4. **Effort**: Engineering weeks required?
5. **Dependencies**: What must happen first?

**RICE Scoring Example**:
- **Bulk Upload**: (1200 users √ó 2 impact √ó 80% confidence) / 4 weeks = 480
- **API Access**: (200 users √ó 3 impact √ó 60% confidence) / 4 weeks = 90
- **Mobile App**: (100 users √ó 2 impact √ó 30% confidence) / 12 weeks = 5

‚Üí Bulk Upload prioritized highest
