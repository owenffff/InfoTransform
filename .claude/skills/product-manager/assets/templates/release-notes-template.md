## What's New üéâ

### Bulk File Upload
Upload multiple documents at once with our new drag-and-drop bulk upload feature.

**What you can do now**:
- Drag up to 50 files at once into the upload zone
- Upload entire folders with one click
- See all your files with their sizes and types before processing
- Remove individual files from the batch before processing

**Why it matters**: Save time when processing large batches of documents. What used to take 10 minutes of clicking now takes 10 seconds of dragging.

- View overall progress percentage
- Get estimated time remaining
- Identify which files succeeded or failed

**Why it matters**: No more wondering if the system is still working. You get transparency and confidence that your documents are being processed.

## Bug Fixes üêõ

- **Progress tracking**: Resolved a problem that caused progress updates to freeze at 50% for large PDF files. Progress now updates smoothly.
- **Model selection**: Corrected an issue where the selected model would reset after adding more files. Your selection now persists.
- **Result display**: Fixed formatting issues in the results table when extracting data with long text fields.

---

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Safari compatibility**: Drag-and-drop may not work consistently in Safari 15 or earlier. Please upgrade to Safari 16+ or use Chrome/Edge.
