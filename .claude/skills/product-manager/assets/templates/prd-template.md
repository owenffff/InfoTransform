## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraph summary of what this PRD covers, the problem being solved, and the proposed solution. This should be readable by executives who may not read the full document.]

**Example**:
> This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing bulk document processing in InfoTransform. Currently, users can only upload and process one file at a time, which is inefficient for business analysts who need to process 20-50 documents daily. We propose adding bulk upload via drag-and-drop, parallel processing, and real-time progress tracking. This feature is expected to reduce processing time by 60% and increase user satisfaction from 7.2 to 8.5. Implementation is estimated at 4 weeks with a target release in Q4 2024.

## 1. Background & Context

### 1.1 Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**

[Detailed description of the user problem or business opportunity. Include data, user research, or customer feedback that validates this problem.]

**Example**:
> User research reveals that 78% of InfoTransform users process 10 or more documents per session. With the current single-file upload, users spend an average of 12 minutes per session just uploading files. This creates frustration and reduces productivity. Customer support has received 45 tickets in Q3 requesting bulk upload functionality.

### 1.2 Business Case

**Why should we build this?**

- **User Impact**: [How many users affected? How significant is the impact?]
- **Business Impact**: [Revenue impact? Retention? Acquisition?]
- **Competitive Impact**: [How does this position us vs competitors?]
- **Strategic Alignment**: [How does this align with company goals?]

**Example**:
- **User Impact**: 78% of users (1,200 active users) will benefit
- **Business Impact**: Estimated to reduce churn by 15% among power users
- **Competitive Impact**: All 3 major competitors offer bulk upload; we risk losing users
- **Strategic Alignment**: Supports Q4 goal of improving product efficiency metrics

### 1.3 Assumptions & Constraints

**Assumptions**:
- [Assumption 1: e.g., Users have stable internet connections]
- [Assumption 2: e.g., Most batches will be under 50 files]
- [Assumption 3: e.g., File types remain the same (PDF, images, audio)]

**Constraints**:
- [Constraint 1: e.g., Must work within existing backend infrastructure]
- [Constraint 2: e.g., No additional cloud storage budget]
- [Constraint 3: e.g., Must maintain sub-5-second response time]

- **Scenario**: Sarah receives 40 vendor invoices via email at month-end. She needs to extract invoice data (date, vendor, amount, line items) into Excel for her manager's review.
- **Current Experience**: Downloads each PDF from email, uploads one-by-one to InfoTransform, waits for each to process, copies results to Excel. Takes 90 minutes.
- **Desired Experience**: Downloads all 40 PDFs to a folder, drags entire folder into InfoTransform, reviews progress, exports all results to Excel at once. Takes 20 minutes.
