## 1. Feature Overview

### Problem Statement
**What problem does this solve?**

[Describe the user pain point or business need. Include data or research if available.]

**Example:**
> Users currently cannot upload multiple files at once, requiring them to upload files one-by-one which is time-consuming when processing batches of documents.

### Proposed Solution
**What are we building?**

[High-level description of the feature and how it solves the problem.]

**Example:**
> Implement bulk file upload functionality that allows users to select and upload multiple files simultaneously via drag-and-drop or file browser.

### Success Metrics
**How will we measure success?**

- [Metric 1]: [Target] (e.g., 80% of users use bulk upload within first month)
- [Metric 2]: [Target] (e.g., Average upload time reduced by 50%)
- [Metric 3]: [Target] (e.g., User satisfaction score increases from 7.2 to 8.5)
