## Customizing the Skill

### Adding Your Own Best Practices

1. **Navigate to the PM best practices folder**:
   ```
   .claude/skills/product-manager/assets/pm-best-practices/
   ```

2. **Fill in placeholder files** with your organization's processes and examples

3. **Or create new files** for additional topics:
   ```bash
   # Example: Add a file about product strategy
   touch assets/pm-best-practices/product-strategy.md
   ```

4. **Use the _README.md** in that folder for guidance on structure and content

---

### Adding Examples from Your Product

Enhance templates and best practices with real examples from your product:

- **In feature specs**: Reference actual features you've built
- **In user stories**: Use real user personas from your product
- **In release notes**: Include actual release notes you've published
- **In roadmaps**: Show real roadmap examples (anonymized if needed)

This makes the skill more practical and tailored to your context.

---

## Tips for Effective Use

### 1. Start with Discovery
Before writing specs, use the discovery template to gather information:
- What problem are we solving?
- Who has this problem?
- How will we measure success?

### 2. Choose the Right Format
Match the documentation type to your audience and stage:
- **Early exploration** ‚Üí Discovery template
- **Pre-development planning** ‚Üí PRD or Feature Spec
- **Development phase** ‚Üí User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
- **Launch communication** ‚Üí Release Notes
- **Strategic planning** ‚Üí Roadmap

### 3. Iterate and Collaborate
Product docs are living documents:
- Share drafts early with engineering, design, and stakeholders
- Incorporate feedback
- Keep docs updated as requirements evolve
- Use version history tables to track changes

### 4. Be User-Centric
Always frame features from the user's perspective:
- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Use user stories: "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
- Include real user quotes and research data
- Define success from the user's point of view

### 5. Use Data
Support decisions with evidence:
- User research findings
- Analytics and usage data
- Support ticket trends
- Competitive analysis
- Success metrics and KPIs

4. **Fill placeholders**: Add your organization's best practices over time
5. **Version templates**: Track changes to understand evolution

### Contributing to the Skill

If working with a team:
- Rotate ownership of different best practices
- Hold PM best practices review sessions
- Share learnings from recent launches
- Create a changelog for significant updates

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know where to start"
‚Üí Start with the discovery template to gather information, then choose the appropriate documentation type

### "The templates are too detailed"
‚Üí Use them as a guide, not a checklist. Adapt sections based on feature complexity

### "I need a format not covered here"
‚Üí Create your own template in the assets folder following the existing structure

### "The skill isn't using my custom best practices"
‚Üí Ensure your files are in the correct folder and follow markdown formatting
