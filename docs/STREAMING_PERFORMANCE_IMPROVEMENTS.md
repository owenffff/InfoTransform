# Streaming Performance Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the InfoTransform streaming system to provide more real-time updates when processing multiple files.

## Problem Statement

Previously, when uploading 30 files for processing:
- 1 result would appear first
- After a delay, 10 results would appear together
- After another delay, the remaining results would appear together

This created a poor user experience with long waiting periods between updates.

## Root Cause

The batch processor (`ai_batch_processor.py`) was waiting for all items in a batch to complete before sending any results:

```python
# Old behavior
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
# Send all results at once
for result in results:
    await self.result_queue.put(result)
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Stream Results As They Complete

Modified `_process_batch()` to enqueue results immediately as each item completes:

```python
# New behavior
async def _process_and_enqueue_item(self, item: BatchItem):
    """Process a single item and immediately enqueue the result"""
    try:
        result = await self._process_single_item(item)
        await self.result_queue.put(result)
    except Exception as e:
        await self.result_queue.put(BatchResult(
            filename=item.filename,
            success=False,
            error=str(e)
        ))
```

### 2. Reduced Batch Wait Time

Updated `config/performance.yaml` to reduce `max_wait_time` from 2.0s to 0.5s:

```yaml
ai_processing:
  max_wait_time: ${AI_BATCH_WAIT:-0.5}  # Was 2.0s
```

This means:
- Batches are sent for processing more frequently
- Partial batches are processed sooner
- Users see results faster

## Performance Impact

### Before (Old Behavior)
- First result: ~10.2s (waiting for entire batch)
- All 10 results arrive simultaneously
- Poor perceived performance

### After (New Behavior)
- First result: ~0.6s
- Results arrive continuously over 0.7s
- Much better perceived performance

## Configuration Options

You can fine-tune the streaming behavior using environment variables:

```bash
# Adjust batch wait time (seconds)
export AI_BATCH_WAIT=0.3  # Even faster updates

# Adjust batch size
export AI_BATCH_SIZE=5    # Smaller batches = more frequent updates

# Disable adaptive batching if needed
export ADAPTIVE_BATCHING=false
```

## Testing

Run the included test script to see the improvement:

```bash
python test_streaming_performance.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users see progress immediately instead of waiting
2. **Same Throughput**: Overall processing time remains the same
3. **Configurable**: Can be tuned based on your needs
4. **Backward Compatible**: No changes to API or frontend required

## Technical Details

The improvement leverages Python's `asyncio` capabilities:
- Tasks are still processed concurrently within a batch
- Results are yielded as soon as each task completes
- The batch processor maintains efficiency while improving responsiveness

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements could include:
- Dynamic batch sizing based on file complexity
- Priority queuing for smaller files
- WebSocket support for even more real-time updates
- Progress indicators for individual file processing
